<h1>The Package to hold all Entity Classes for Kabasuji</h1>

Entities in Kabasuji hold the current state of the program in each object within the Application itself.  Level Builder and the Kabasuji Application share many entities in our project. The key entities of a game level are Level (and its three subclasses), Board, Bullpen, Tile, and Block.
